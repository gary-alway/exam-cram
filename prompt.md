# Exam Notes Style Guide

## Structure
- Group by topic/service - integrate new notes into existing sections, don't just append
- Bullet points with 4-space indent for sub-details
- Tables for direct comparisons (A vs B)

## Content style
- Ultra-brief, exam-focused - one line per fact
- Define acronyms (e.g., "IVF = Inverted File Index")
- Use → for flows/relationships (e.g., "GuardDuty → EventBridge → Lambda")
- Highlight gotchas with emphasis: "CANNOT", "NOT", "does NOT"

## Exam patterns
- Include trigger words: "If you see X → answer is Y"
- Call out common traps (what people confuse)
- Scenario tables where helpful (scenario | answer)

## Avoid
- No code comments
- No fluff or explanations
- No duplicating what's already covered

## Guiding principle
*"What's the minimum I need to remember to get the exam question right?"*
